Task1:
-----
Programs, Task1A and Task1B, exchanging symmetric keys using asymetric encryption.

To run both programs please run the batch file "run.bat".

The scripts have been made executable to prevent the user from having to install additional libraries to run the scripts.

If this does not work, please run the "runPythonProgs.bat" file to run the programs as python scripts.
If this still does not work (it really should), please run the scripts "Task1(A/B).py" from separate consoles.

You will need to press the Enter key when prompted by the console running task1A, to
go through the various steps of the secret key exchange process. 

Both programs will be printing out statements through the process, showing what steps are being taken.
